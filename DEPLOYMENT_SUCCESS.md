## **🌐 INSTANT DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

Since interactive CLI can be challenging, here are the fastest deployment methods:

### **Option 1: Netlify Drop (30 seconds) ⚡**
1. **Open**: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag & Drop**: Your entire `dist/` folder onto the page
3. **Wait**: 20-30 seconds for deployment
4. **Get**: Instant live URL (e.g., `https://amazing-name.netlify.app`)

### **Option 2: GitHub + Netlify Auto-Deploy**
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy Calert"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Connect to Netlify**: Go to https://app.netlify.com/start
3. **Select your repo**: Netlify will use your `netlify.toml` config automatically
4. **Auto-deploy**: Every push triggers a new deployment

### **Option 3: Netlify CLI (Manual Install)**
If you want to use CLI, install it first:
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
sudo npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```
