# Server-side Gemini API key for Express server (server.js)
# Set this in your production runtime (Cloud Run, Docker, or local shell) before starting the server.
# Example (local):
#   API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY node server.js
# Example (Docker/Cloud Run): configure API_KEY as a runtime environment variable.

# Frontend build-time key exposed to Vite-bundled code if needed
# Place this in .env.local for local SPA development with Vite.
# Note: server.js does NOT read this. It only reads API_KEY at runtime.
